        <h3>Typical demo setup</h3>
        <p>All of the examples are set up in the same way:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>HTML elements to represent state, and buttons to call actions</li>
            <li>Global CSS styles to make the page look pretty, with local styles where required</li>
            <li>A page script to configure the states and handlers and create the StateMachine</li>
            <li>A call to a StateHelper (see below) which takes care of the base wiring from the StateMachine to your UI</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The code for the example above is:</p>
<pre>
var fsm = new StateMachine({
    transitions: [
        'next : a > b > c',
        'back : a < b < c'
    ]
});

StateHelper.jQuery(fsm);
</pre>
        <p>This code sets up the StateMachine's transitions (actions and states) and in is where you add additional event listeners, configuration, etc.</p>
        <p>The call to StateHelper is optional, but it can used to quickly wire up a UI (see below).</p>

        <p class="text-danger" style="margin-top:40px;">Note the following regarding all demo files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The code is similar across demos</li>
            <li>All the code for each demo is on the page</li>
            <li>The StateMachine for each demo is accessible via the console, e.g. <code>fsm.do('next')</code></li>
            <li>Check console for additional output</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="events">
        <h3>Basic handler/event setup</h3>
        <p>StateMachine communicates changes in its state to the outside world via events.</p>
        <p>In order to respond to a system changing state, you need to assign event handlers, either through the config, or manually:</p>
<pre>
// config
handlers: {
    'change': function(event, fsm) {
        // update ui
        // do stuff
    }
}

// manually
fsm.on('change', function(event, fsm) {
    // update ui
    // do stuff
});
</pre>
    </section>

    <section id="events">

        <h3>Handlers for a connected UI</h3>
        <p>There are various states you'll want to to monitor to reflect available actions, states and transition for any connected UI, and they are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>system.change</code></li>
            <li><code>transition.pause</code>, <code>transition.resume</code> and <code>transition.cancel</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you think your system will have additional state and/or actions added or removed, you'll also need to listen to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>state.add</code> and <code>state.remove</code></li>
            <li><code>action.add</code> and <code>action.remove</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As with vanilla JavaScript, any passed events will contain information regarding the state change, and you should update your UI accordingly.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="helpers">
        <h3>Helpers</h3>
        <p>Although it's quite straightforward to set up event handlers yourself, the JavaScript code is essentially the same between applications, so a class, <code>StateHelper</code>, is provided to give you one-liner setup of the very basics, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current state</li>
            <li>Available actions</li>
            <li>Whether the transition is paused or not</li>
        </ul>
        <p>StateHelper has a few environment-specific methods that cater for jQuery, Vue, etc., that auto-wire UIs, depending on your setup.</p>
        <p>It is strongly advised if you are going to use StateHelper, to look at and understand the underlying code. It's not at all complicated, but it is recommended to get a handle on pub/sub setup.</p>
        <p>See the next section for more info.</p>
